# Make a Mac feel more like a Windows PC
Summary of settings to change 

## Display (external monitors)
(If you're using a MacBook or an iMac you don't need to worry about this)

Go to System Settings > Displays

### Refresh Rate
macOS may default refresh rate to the lowest setting, which will make the computer feel slow and choppy. Set the refresh rate to the highest setting supported by your monitor. 

### Resolution
macOS doesn't have UI scaling like Windows. If you're using an external monitor that isn't high resolution (less than 4k) you have to choose between slightly-too-small or an oversized UI.

Default resolution is the small version. There's also a HiDPI setting that will greatly increase the UI size. Depending on which you pick, you will be increasing or descreasing the UI scale of all other.

### App Scaling
Because macOS doesn't have UI scaling, you have to adjust the UI size for every app and some system functions individually.

_macOS_
Go to Accessibility > Display
- Text > Text size: Increase or decrease depending on your resolution
- Menu bar size: Increase on low res
- Pointer size: Increase on low res

Go to Desktop & Dock

## Mouse
Turn off "Natural scrolling" to change the direction the page moves to match Windows. 

Go to Advanced... > Pointer Acceleration and try it with the setting off. Windows has a similar setting that you may or may not have set up on your PC. Go with whatever feels best.
